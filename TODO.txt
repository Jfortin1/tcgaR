1. methylumi set for 27k data
2. histone modification?
3. mappings function. independent
4. function for n.samples
5. add function that list the cancers available.
6. for RNA data, add a function that changes the names of the samples
according to the mappings
7. Add a function that looks at the overlap of methylation data and gene expression data.




Vignette:
- add table that describes the number of samples for each cancer type
- add a pipeline for processing the rgset in minfi:
  1. preprocessNoob()
  2. preprocessFunnorm()
